# 🌐 Web Projects

Collection of my early and intermediate web dev projects, migrated from my old GitHub account and organized here under my new profile **@GrizX4051k**.

## 🧱 Tech stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Basic responsive layouts
- JS and simple DOM manipulation
- Some experiments with forms, animations, and small UI components

## 📂 Projects inside this repo

- `project-8- netflix-clone/`

*(I’ll gradually add live demos / screenshots as I clean each project.)*

## 🎯 What this repo shows

- My foundation in web fundamentals (no heavy frameworks).
- Ability to structure static sites and small interactive pages.
- Growth path toward modern stacks (React, Node, etc.) that I’m now focusing on.

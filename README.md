# Web Frontend Projects

This repo is my space for practicing and building **modern frontend** projects – from pure HTML/CSS to React and Next.js.

## 🎯 Goals

- Sharpen my **UI and UX** skills with real, deployable projects.
- Get comfortable with **modern frontend tools** and workflows.
- Build a solid base for **full‑stack** and **mobile** (React Native) development.

---

## 🧰 Tech Focus

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Frameworks / Libraries:** React, Next.js  
- **Styling:** CSS, Flexbox, Grid, Tailwind (gradually)  
- **Tooling:** npm, Vite/Next dev servers, browser DevTools

## Project map

Each folder is a focused frontend project or experiment. Most have their own HTML/CSS/JS plus any assets they need.

| Folder / Project             | Type                     | Highlights                                             |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `blog-template-responsive`   | Responsive blog layout   | Multi‑section layout, typography, mobile‑first design  |
| `dragon-game-javascript`     | JavaScript mini‑game     | Keyboard controls, collision logic, simple game loop   |
| `e-commerce-project`         | E‑commerce UI            | Product cards, nav, basic cart/CTA flows               |
| `food-delivery`              | Landing page / UI        | Hero section, menu sections, responsive grid           |
| `gym-website`                | Landing page / marketing | Sections, call‑to‑action blocks, responsive layout     |
| `image-grid-responsive`      | Image gallery            | CSS Grid/Flexbox, responsive image grid                |
| `myntra-clone`               | UI clone                 | Real‑world e‑commerce layout, nav, filters             |
| `netflix-clone`              | UI clone                 | Horizontal carousels, hero banner, media‑style layout  |
| `spotify-clone`              | UI clone                 | Music app layout, sidebar + content area               |
| `test-spotify-clone-2021`    | Experimental clone       | Earlier Spotify clone experiment and layout testing    |
| `index.html` / `style.css` / `main.js` | Root demo page | Small standalone frontend sitting at the repo root     |

## 📁 What’s Inside

Each folder in this repo is a standalone project. Typical patterns include:

- Simple **landing pages** and layouts (HTML/CSS)
- **Responsive** designs (mobile‑first)
- Small **JavaScript** mini‑projects
- **React** apps (components, hooks, routing)
- **Next.js** projects (pages, routing, basic data fetching)

Example structure for a project:

```text
project-name/
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/        # images, icons, fonts
│  ├─ styles/        # CSS or Tailwind files
│  ├─ components/    # React components (if applicable)
│  └─ index.html / main.jsx / App.tsx
├─ package.json      # if using React/Next.js
└─ README.md

## How to run projects

Most projects are either **static frontends** (HTML/CSS/JS) or small React/Next apps. Running them is simple.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrizX4051k/Web-Development.git
cd Web-Development

2. Pure HTML/CSS/JS projects
For folders that are just HTML/CSS/JS:

bash
cd 04-landing-page
# Option A: open index.html directly in your browser
# Option B: run a simple dev server
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
You can also use VS Code Live Server or npx serve if you prefer.

3. Projects with Node/Vite/Next.js
If a project has a package.json, it uses npm scripts:

bash
cd 12-react-playground
npm install
npm run dev   # or npm start / npm run build && npm run preview, depending on the project
Each project’s own README explains the exact commands if they differ. '
```
## Frontend practices in this repo

This is not just a set of exercises; I use it to practice **real frontend engineering habits**.

### Separation of concerns

- HTML for **structure and semantics**.  
- CSS (or a utility framework) for **layout, design, and animation**.  
- JavaScript/React for **behavior and state**, with logic kept in modules instead of inline scripts.

### Readable, intentional components

- Clear component boundaries in React (small, focused components).  
- Naming that reflects intent: files and functions tell you what they do before you read the internals.  
- Reusable patterns (buttons, cards, forms) instead of one‑off spaghetti.

### Incremental complexity

Projects are ordered so you can see progression:

> static pages → responsive layouts → vanilla JS interactivity → React components → Next.js + basic data fetching

You can review how I move from simple markup to richer UX and stateful apps.

### Reproducible setups

- Plain HTML/CSS projects work in any modern browser with no build step.  
- Tooling‑based projects stick to standard npm scripts so they’re easy to run on any machine.

## Tech stack

Even though many projects are intentionally lightweight, there is a consistent environment behind them:

- **Languages:** HTML5, modern CSS, JavaScript (with some TypeScript)  
- **Frameworks / Libraries:** React, Next.js (for selected projects)  
- **Styling:** vanilla CSS, Flexbox, Grid, utility‑first approaches (Tailwind gradually)  
- **Tooling:** npm, Vite/Next dev servers, browser DevTools  

---

## Roadmap

Over time I plan to add:

- More polished **end‑to‑end mini‑apps** (auth + CRUD + nice UI).  
- A small **design system** for buttons, inputs, and cards that I can reuse across projects.  
- A couple of **full‑stack samples** that connect these frontends to simple APIs.

## About me

I’m **Manish Kumar** (`@GrizX4051k`), an aspiring software engineer who enjoys both low‑level C and modern web UI work.

If you’re browsing this as a recruiter or engineer:

- You’ll see how I handle **frontend fundamentals**: layout, styling, interactivity, and project structure.  
- You can open any folder and quickly understand what it is, why it exists, and how to run it.

Suggestions, refactors, or ideas for new mini‑projects are always welcome – open an issue or PR and I’ll gladly take a look.
